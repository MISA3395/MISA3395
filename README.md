# Hi, I'm Misa!👋  


## 🚀 About Me
I'm a software engineer, based in the United Kingdom. 

I have been studying Python at Hyperion Dev Bootcamp for 4 month now. After gaining experience as a Japanese teacher and logistics assistant, I am passionate about Python junior software engineering now and I am learning every day to make the world a better place as a programmer. I do enjoy very very much what I learn.

```python
class Misa:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Misa Kamijo"
        self.dob = "1995-09-07"
        self.work = 'Junior Software Engineer'
        self.education1 = 'Atomi University of Tokyo'
        self.education2 = 'Hyperion Dev Bootcamp'
        self.hobbies = [
            'Watching Formula 1, movies',
            'Cooking',
            'Travelling'
        ]

    def current_location(self):
        return 'Birmingham, United Kingdom'

    def previous_locations(self):
        return 'Tokyo, Japan'

misa = Misa()

print("I'm", misa.name)
print("My birthday is", misa.dob)
print("I work as:", misa.work)
print("I graduated from", misa.education1)
print("currently studying software engineering at", misa.education2)
print("Hobbies:", misa.hobbies)
print("Current Location:", misa.current_location())
print("Previous Locations:", misa.previous_locations())
```
